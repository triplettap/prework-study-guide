        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) gives the content of a web application structure.</li>
            <li>HTML is made up of elements - types of content.</li>
            <li>Common elements used to add content to pages include text, images, headers, and lists.</li>
            <li>Elements can also work "behind-the-scenes" to divide the content or describe it to browsers and developers.</li>
            <li>Common "behind-the-scenes" elements are meta-related, content division, and semantic.</li>
            <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
            <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>
            <li>The head element contains information that helps the browser render the page correctly, and elements included within it are not visible to the user.</li>
            <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the webpage user.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element and is always in the beginning element.</li>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements, and the element that holds all the children is known as the parent element.</li>
            <li>Semantic HTML elements use the element name to describe its content and function.</li>
            <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
   
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS styles elements directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet embeds directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>An external style sheet links a seperate file using a link element in the HTML's head element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code.</li>
          <li>GitHub is connected to Git, which is software on your computer that tracks changes that you make to your code.</li>
          <li>Changes to your code are called commits.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git.</li>
          <li>To follow GitHub flow you must create a branch, make commits within that branch, create a pull request, and merge the pull request.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
   
      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript allows users to interact with websites through effects, interactivity, data communication, etc.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>One way to create conditional statements is an if statement.</li>
          <li>When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>An index is unique number that identifies the location of a data item in an array.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>You must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
